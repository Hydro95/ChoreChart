# Contribution Instructions

In order to make this clear + avoid most merge conflicts, you should make a pull request on this repo after coding in your own branch so changes can be reviewed + conflicts can be resolved easier. Here is what you need to do:

## Make a branch

You should use ```git branch [your name]``` to create a branch that will host your version of the project while you make changes. Switch to this branch by typing ```git checkout [your name]```.

## Make changes

You can now make any changes and commit/push like normal. Make sure you push using ```git push origin [your name]``` so the changes go into your branch instead of the main repo.

## Making a pull request

When you're finished making changes, commit and push your changes. Visit the repo page and you'll see a button called "New Pull Request" To the left of the branch selector. Click this and compare the changes to the master branch. If there are no conflicts the files will be marked as able to merge without conflict and you can submit the pull request. The pull request will appear on the main repo page to be reviewed and closed, which merges the changes into the main repo.

# PS

If you haven't already done so, make sure to sign up for Hacktoberfest at http://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ . By making 4 pull requests or more during October you can get a bunch of free stickers and a T shirt.
